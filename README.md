This is a minimal quantum computing simulator that demonstrates 1 and 2-qubit systems written in Python.

It was created as a learning project while exploring quantum computing related research opportunities. 

The simulation demonstrates two concepts in quantum computing:

1- Superposition via the Hadamard gate
2- Entanglement via H + CNOT, which create a Bell State
